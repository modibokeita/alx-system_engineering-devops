what happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter?

Introduction:

Have you ever wondered what happens when you type an URL into your browser and hit Enter?

The process seems seamless, but under the hood, a complex series of events unfold to bring you the web page you requested.
In this blog post, we'll take a deep dive into the journey of a simple browser request, from initial DSN lookup to the final
rendering of the web page.

1- DNS Request:
the journey starts when you type https://www.google.com into your browser.
The browser initiates a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup to translate the human-readable domain www.google.com name into an IP
adress. This lookup involves querying a DNS server, which returns the corresponding IP adress of Google's servers.

2- TCP/IP:
Armed with the IP address, the browser establishes a transimission control Protocol (TCP) connection with the Google server using
the Internet Protocol(IP). TCP ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data packets between the client (browser) and the server.

3- Firewall:

As the TCP connection is established, it may travers through various network devices, including firewalls.
Firewall act as gatekeepers, enforcing security policies to filter and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic.
they ensure that only authorized connections are allowed while blocking potential threats.

4 - HTTPS/SSL:
In the case https://" URLs like "https://www.google.com, the connection is secured using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
(HTTPS) which apply Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or its successor, Transport Layer Security(TLS). This encryption layer ensures that
the data exchanged between the client and server remains confidential and cannot be intercepted by malicious entities.

5- Load-Balancer:

Upon receiving the request, Google's infrastructure may utilize load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple
servers. Load balancers improve scalability, reliability, and availability by evenly distributing the workload among servers
based on factors like server health and current traffic load.

6- Web Server:
Once the request reaches a Google server, a web server such as Apache, Nginx, or Google's proprietary infrastructure
processes the request. The web server retrieves the requested web page or resource and prepares it for delivery back
to the client.

7- Application Server:
For dynamic web pages or applications requiring server-side processing, the web server may communicate with an application
server. The application server executes the necessary code (e.g., PHP, Python, Java) to generate the content dynamically
before sending it back to the web server for delivery.

8- Database:
In scenarios where the requested content relies on data stored in a database, the application server interacts with the
database server to retrieve or manipulate the required data. This interaction involves querying the database using
Structured Query Language (SQL) or other database-specific protocols.

9- Conclusion:
The journey of a browser request from typing a URL to rendering a web page involves numerous components working together
seamlessly. Understanding this process provides valuable insights into how the web stack operates and enables us to
appreciate the complexity behind seemingly simple interactions. As technology continues to evolve, so too will the
mechanisms and components involved in serving web content, making it an endlessly fascinating field to explore.
